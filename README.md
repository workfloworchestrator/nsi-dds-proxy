# nsi-dds-proxy

The NSI Document Distribution Service proxy offers a REST API to retrieve
topologies, switching services, service termination points, and service
demarcation points from the combined topology documents found on the DDS.  The
information returned is a subset as needed by NSI ultimate Requester Agents
like the NSI Orchestrator, SENSE, and others.

## Project ANA-GRAM

This software is being developed by the 
[Advanced North-Atlantic Consortium](https://www.anaeng.global/), 
a cooperation between National Education and Research Networks (NRENs) and 
research partners to provide network connectivity for research and education 
across the North-Atlantic, as part of the ANA-GRAM (ANA Global Resource Aggregation Method) project. 

The goal of the ANA-GRAM project is to federate the ANA trans-Atlantic links through
[Network Service Interface (NSI)](https://ogf.org/documents/GFD.237.pdf)-based automation.
This will enable the automated provisioning of L2 circuits spanning different domains 
between research parties on other sides of the Atlantic. The ANA-GRAM project is 
spearheaded by the ANA Platform & Requirements Working Group, under guidance of the 
ANA Engineering and ANA Planning Groups.

**Color legend:**

| Color | Meaning |

| Purple | Existing software deployed in every participating network |

| Orange | Software being developed as part of ANA-GRAM |
| Yellow | Future software to be developed as part of ANA-GRAM |

**Components:**

- [**ANA Frontend**](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator) — Future management portal that will provide a comprehensive overview of all configured services on the ANA infrastructure, including real-time operational status information.
- [**NSI Orchestrator**](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/nsi-orchestrator) — Central orchestration layer that manages the lifecycle of topologies, switching services, STPs, SDPs, and multi-domain connections. It uses the DDS Proxy for topology visibility and the NSI Aggregator Proxy as its Network Resource Manager.
- [**DDS Proxy**](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/nsi-dds-proxy) (this repository) — Fetches NML topology documents from the upstream DDS, parses them, and exposes the data as a JSON REST API.
- [**NSI Aggregator Proxy**](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/nsi-aggregator-proxy) — Translates simple REST/JSON calls into NSI Connection Service v2 SOAP messages toward the NSI Aggregator, abstracting NSI protocol complexity behind a linear state machine.
- [**DDS**](https://github.com/BandwidthOnDemand/nsi-dds) — The NSI Document Distribution Service, a distributed registry where networks publish and discover NML topology documents and NSA descriptions.
- [**PCE**](https://github.com/BandwidthOnDemand/nsi-pce) — The NSI Path Computation Element, which computes end-to-end paths across multiple network domains using topology information from the DDS.
- [**NSI Aggregator (Safnari)**](https://github.com/BandwidthOnDemand/nsi-safnari) — An NSI Connection Service v2.1 Aggregator that coordinates connection requests across multiple provider domains, using the PCE for path computation.
- [**SuPA**](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/SuPA) — The SURF ultimate Provider Agent, an NSI Provider Agent that manages circuit reservation, creation, and removal within a single network domain. Uses gRPC instead of SOAP, and is always deployed together with [**PolyNSI**](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/PolyNSI), a bidirectional SOAP-to-gRPC translation proxy.

## Prerequisites

- A valid client certificate and private key for mutual TLS authentication with the DDS server.
- Python 3.13+ (for running from source) or Docker.

## Configuration

All settings can be configured via environment variables or a `dds_proxy.env` file placed in the working directory. Environment variables take precedence over the env file.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DDS_BASE_URL` | `https://your-dds-server/dds` | Base URL of the upstream DDS server. |
| `DDS_CLIENT_CERT` | _(unset)_ | Path to the PEM-encoded client certificate used for mutual TLS with the DDS server. |
| `DDS_CLIENT_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Path to the PEM-encoded private key corresponding to the client certificate. |
| `DDS_CA_BUNDLE` | _(unset)_ | Path to a PEM file containing the CA certificates used to verify the DDS server. When set, replaces the system CA store entirely. |
| `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `60` | How long (in seconds) the DDS response is cached before the next upstream fetch. |
| `HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `30.0` | Timeout (in seconds) for HTTP requests to the DDS server. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity. Accepted values: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`. |
| `DDS_PROXY_HOST` | `localhost` | Interface the server binds to. Set to `0.0.0.0` to accept connections on all interfaces. |
| `DDS_PROXY_PORT` | `8000` | TCP port the server listens on. |
| `ROOT_PATH` | _(empty)_ | ASGI root path prefix. Set when serving behind a reverse proxy that strips a path prefix (e.g. `/dds-proxy`). Ensures Swagger UI loads the OpenAPI spec from the correct URL. Does not affect route matching. |

A ready-to-use template is provided in `dds_proxy.env`. The application automatically reads this file from the working directory when it starts, so in most cases you only need to edit it in place.

If you want to maintain multiple configurations (e.g. for different environments), copy it and pass the copy explicitly via `docker run --env-file` or by exporting the variables in your shell:

```bash
cp dds_proxy.env production.env
# edit production.env

# Use with Docker:
docker run --env-file production.env ...

# Use in your shell (exports all non-comment lines as environment variables):
export $(grep -v '^#' production.env | xargs)
dds-proxy
```

Note that `docker run --env-file` expects plain `KEY=VALUE` lines — no `export` keyword, no quotes around values. The provided `dds_proxy.env` is already in this format.

## Running the Application

### From source with uv

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
uv sync
dds-proxy
```

The `dds-proxy` entry point starts a Uvicorn server using the host and port from your configuration. Make sure `dds_proxy.env` is present in the directory you run the command from, or export the required environment variables beforehand.

### With Python directly

If you have the package installed in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install .
dds-proxy
```

Or invoke Uvicorn manually, which lets you override host, port, and the number of workers:

```bash
uvicorn dds_proxy.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

Note that when using `uvicorn` directly, `DDS_PROXY_HOST` and `DDS_PROXY_PORT` are ignored — pass them as CLI arguments instead.

### With Docker

A pre-built image is available on the GitHub Container Registry:

```
ghcr.io/workfloworchestrator/nsi-dds-proxy:0.1.0
```

Run it directly, mounting your certificate files and passing configuration via environment variables:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/your/certs:/certs:ro \
  -e DDS_CLIENT_CERT=/certs/client-certificate.pem \
  -e DDS_CLIENT_KEY=/certs/client-private-key.pem \
  -e DDS_CA_BUNDLE=/certs/ca-bundle.pem \
  -e DDS_BASE_URL=https://your-dds-server/dds \
  ghcr.io/workfloworchestrator/nsi-dds-proxy:0.1.0
```

Or pass all settings via an env file:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/your/certs:/certs:ro \
  --env-file production.env \
  ghcr.io/workfloworchestrator/nsi-dds-proxy:0.1.0
```

If you prefer to build the image yourself:

```bash
docker build -t nsi-dds-proxy .
```

### On Kubernetes

Store your client certificate and key in a Secret, then reference them in a Deployment:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic dds-proxy-certs \
  --from-file=client-certificate.pem=/path/to/client-certificate.pem \
  --from-file=client-private-key.pem=/path/to/client-private-key.pem \
  --from-file=ca-bundle.pem=/path/to/ca-bundle.pem
```
